### üß© Just For You Carousel
Upon arriving on this page, the first thing you'll encounter is a large carousel at the top. This carousel highlights articles and workouts that are best suited to your individual needs and preferences. It provides a personalized selection among the wide array of content available in the catalogs. 
### üìö Catalogs 
The catalogs offer a flexible way to search for articles and workouts. You can filter the results based on various factors and utilize an integrated search bar that not only searches through article titles but also through related tags and keywords.

From the left button, you can toggle between three main catalogs:
- Just for You: Workouts and articles related to your profile.
- Explore All: Browse through all available workouts and articles.
- Saved: Access all the articles and workouts that you have saved.

There are currently two types of articles:
- **Routine**: Saving this type of article adds pre-made routines to your profile.
- **Video**: This type of article is saved to your personal catalog for later access.

You can **unsave an article** by pressing the same button at the bottom of the page. It's important to note that:
- A saved article won't appear in the other two catalogs.
- When unsaving a routine article, the routines won't be automatically deleted from your collection. You'll need to manually remove them from the Routines widget.

Please note that as a solo developer, I've managed to include up to 150 workouts. Therefore, there may be limitations in terms of uniqueness and filtering options within the catalogs presented on the page. I appreciate your understanding.

When you open an article, you'll notice an aside section presenting three related articles. These articles are not random; they are selected based on their relevance to both you and the currently opened article. This allows you to discover more articles similar to the one you're currently reading, enhancing your browsing experience.
