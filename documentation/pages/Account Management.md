Here you'll discover further details about authentication and account management.

### üîë Registration & Login
Upon registration, you'll be prompted to provide a valid email and a password of at least 8 characters. The registration form offers user feedback to validate the data, with validation performed both on the frontend and backend.

After providing a suitable email and password, you'll be redirected to a Profile form where you can insert details about yourself. You also have the option to upload a personal photo or choose from default ones.

Please note that for security reasons, it's not recommended to upload sensitive personal photos. Choose a photo that you feel comfortable with and is safe for you.

Submitting the form completes the account creation process. Following submission, you'll have the opportunity to answer a short questionnaire to customize your profile preferences. Skipping this step will set your profile's preferences to the default ones.

Upon authentication, you receive a token that's valid for 12 hours. Once the session expires, you'll be prompted to log in again. The token is stored on your device, so deleting it will require you to log in again.

### üîê Account Management 
Upon creating your account, a verification email will be sent to you, valid for 48 hours. To access account management actions, you must validate your email via this verification email.

If you miss the initial verification email sent upon registration, you can request a new one, also valid for 48 hours.

Once your email is validated, you can:
- Change the account's email
- Change your password
- Delete your account
To change your email, simply press the button and you'll be redirected to a form where you can make the change.

For a password change request, an email will be sent to your verified email address containing a link to a form where you can change your password. You'll be required to enter the old password before setting a new one. The link is valid for 1 hour.

When you request to delete your account, an email will be sent to your verified email address. Upon opening the link in the email, you'll be prompted to enter the email associated with the account once again to complete the deletion process. This action is irreversible and deletes all data related to the account. The link is valid for 30 minutes.

To test these features, you'll need to create your own account with a valid email address. Demo accounts have these features disabled for security reasons, ensuring proper usage by feature developers.
